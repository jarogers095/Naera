# Næra

Næra is a Sinatra-based web application that allows users to track their daily intake of calories and nutrients. It provides an interface for manually entering nutritional values for foods, selecting which of those foods were consumed on a given day, and displaying a summation of calories and nutrients for that day.

Future additions include water and exercise tracking, API access to the USDA nutritional information database for food searching and importing, and a PWA version.
